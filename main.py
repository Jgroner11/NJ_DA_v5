"""Sweep the session, building a panel video from every window along the way.

Reads parameters.yaml and hands it to video.py, which holds the work. Run from
the project root, after run_umap.py has written the embeddings and
behaviour_plot.m the behaviour figure:

    python main.py
    python main.py --end 600   # only clips starting before 600 s, for a quick run

The session and the cameras come from parameters.yaml. The window does not: the
sweep below sets it per clip, so the start_time_s and duration_s written in the
file are only what a single hand-run would have used, and are overwritten here.

Every window is rendered, including the stretches where the mouse was getting
the task wrong -- it is the incorrect trajectories that are worth watching.
Every patch is on screen in every clip. While the mouse is somewhere a column's
embedding was not fitted on, that column's trail carries on in magenta, at
where run_umap.py placed those bins with UMAP.transform.

Clips are rendered one after another, each frame after the last. Running
several clips at once in separate processes was tried and measured no faster:
one clip's x264 encoder already keeps every core busy.

Everything lands under figures/<session>/ -- see paths.py. The clips go into
clips/, in one folder named for the sweep, so a second sweep at another length
sits beside the first rather than mixing into it. The interactive plots go into
umap/, written once before the first clip is rendered. Each clip also saves the
frame at every trial end it passes through into trial_ends/, so a trial is only
saved if its last bin falls inside a rendered clip.
