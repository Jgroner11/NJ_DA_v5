"""UMAP embeddings of the binned session — the whole session, its correct
rewarded bins, and each block and each patch both filtered that way and whole.

Reads the CSVs written by embedding_and_labels.m and writes one .npy per embedding into
data/<session>/embeddings/, for the session parameters.yaml names -- see
paths.py. No plotting: this only produces the embeddings.

    umap_full.npy              (n_bins, n_components)   every bin, in file order
    umap_correct_rewarded.npy  (n_kept, n_components)   correct_rewarded

    umap_decision_region.npy   (n_kept, n_components)   in_decision_region

and, for every embedding the video shows other than the full one -- the
correct rewarded, patch and decision region ones -- every bin it was not fitted
on placed into it with UMAP.transform:

    umap_<name>_transformed.npy  (n_bins, n_components)  NaN on the fitted bins

Every selection is made from four per-bin columns, correct.csv and rewarded.csv
(0/1, combined here into correct_rewarded), block_id.csv (the block each bin falls in, the gaps between trials
included) and patch_id.csv (the patch of the port each bin's trial was at, 0
between trials) -- see selections(). A masked embedding's row i is the i-th True
entry of its mask, so the matching times and positions are bin_times.csv[mask]
and head_positions.csv[mask].

Fits are cached by content, so re-running does not refit anything whose inputs
and parameters are unchanged. The cache holds each fitted UMAP object, not just
its coordinates, so a cached fit can still place new bins with UMAP.transform.
UMAP is not seeded here, so the cache is also what keeps an embedding stable
from run to run — delete .cache/umap_*.joblib to force fresh fits.
