"""Panel video: a 7x5 grid, one embedding per column, one colouring per row.

Seven columns, one embedding each, and four rows, one colouring each, then a
fifth row for what is not an embedding:

              Full   CR   P1   P2   P3   P4   Region
    plain      .     .    .    .    .    .    .        with trail
    reward     .     .    .    .    .    .    .        by reward time
    ports      .     .    .    .    .    .    .        by port
    switch     .     .    .    .    .    .    .        by switch / stay group
    row 5    info  maze  behaviour (3 wide) ----   -    -

CR is the correct rewarded bins of every block in one fit, P1..P4 the whole of
each patch -- every bin of every trial the mouse spent at that patch's ports,
so no gaps between trials -- and Region the bins between the two lines of the
Maze lines section in embedding_and_labels.m. A column whose embedding does not
exist -- a patch never visited, or a selection too small to fit -- is left as
blank panels.

Each block's whole embedding is fitted by run_umap.py too, and written out as
the same four interactive plots, but has no column in the video.

Only the plain row carries the moving trail. Where a column's embedding holds
the current bin, the trail dot is on the Turbo ramp at its point; where it does
not, it is magenta, at where run_umap.py placed that bin with UMAP.transform,
so every column is trailed throughout. The coloured panels are static, because their
colorbars and legends shift the plot area, so the fitted pixel maps describe the
plain panels' layout rather than theirs.

The behaviour panel is behaviour_plot.m's figure, with a line at the current
trial, placed from the axis table that script writes beside it.

Every panel is the same square, PANEL pixels a side, which means the maze is now
scaled down to fit one. Its tracking coordinates are therefore no longer pixel
positions in the panel and have to be mapped through the same resize -- see
maze_geometry.

The trailed panels each draw the current bin plus the previous TRAIL_S seconds
of bins, so the same moment is picked out in the maze and in every embedding at
once. Age shows twice over: the dot cools along a colour scale and fades in
opacity at the same time.

The window comes from start_time_s / duration_s in parameters.yaml. There is
one frame per bin: nothing on screen changes within a bin, so a higher frame
rate would only encode the same picture several times over.

Every panel is a cached background with dots painted on in numpy, so no frame
re-renders anything through plotly. Re-rendering the embeddings per frame was
measured at about 11 s a frame, nearly all of it kaleido's fixed per-call cost,
which worked out at five hours for a minute of video.

Painting on a cached background needs to know where a 3D embedding point lands
in the rendered image. umap_plots.fit_projection works that out by rendering one
extra figure of known points and solving for the camera matrix plotly used; see
it for why this is measured rather than derived.

Nothing here reads parameters.yaml or runs on import. main.py loads the file and
calls the three entry points at the foot of this module, in order:

    load_session             read the per-bin data and render every background
    write_interactive_plots  save each embedding as an orbitable html plot
    write_video              paint the trail onto those backgrounds, frame by frame

Needs kaleido (plotly's static image export) and imageio-ffmpeg (the encoder):

    pip install kaleido imageio-ffmpeg
